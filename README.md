# Halo Weapon Rater Program

## Description
This is a simple JavaScript program designed to generate varied messages based on the Halo franchise.
These messages pertain to the weapon sandbox of all the entries, and giving them a comment/statement randomly.
The message is broken down by the game title, the weapon, and a comment regarding the weapon's viability, design, etc.
Ex. Halo 3's + Plasma Rifle + is great at dispatching enemies!
Weapon's covered will only be ones present in all mainline titles.
It's primary purpose is to generate three seperate pieces of a sentence, and formatting them in a single statement.
